Description: The dynamics of transcriptional elongation can influence various 
	biological activities, such as RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and nuclear 
	export. To quantify the elongation rate, a traditional method is to treat 
	cells with drugs that inhibit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from entering the 
	gene body and then track Pol II with Pro-seq or Gro-seq. However, the data 
	analysis is challenged by the problem of identifying the transition point 
	between the gene regions inhibited by the drug and not, which is necessary 
	to infer the transcription rate. Although the traditional hidden Markov 
	model (HMM) can be used to solve it, this method is complicated with its 
	hidden variable and many parameters to be estimated. Hence, we developed 
	the R package proRate, which identifies the transition point with a novel 
	least sum of squares (LSS) method and then calculates the elongation rate 
	accordingly. The performance on several datasets shows that LSS achieves 
	higher accuracy than HMM. In addition, proRate also covers other functions 
	frequently used in transcription dynamic study, such as metagene plotting, 
	pause index calculation, and gene structure analysis.
